.SH NAME
fusionsoundrc \- FusionSound configuration file


.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B fusionsoundrc
file is a configuration file read by all FusionSound applications on startup.
There are two of these: a system-wide one stored in
.I /etc/fusionsoundrc
and a per-user
.I
\fB$HOME\fP/.fusionsoundrc
which may override system settings.

The same parameters that can be used in the
.B fusionsoundrc
file can also be passed to FusionSound applications on the command-line
by prefixing them with 
.BR --fs:
or by setting the environment variable
.BR FSARGS


.SH SYNTAX

The
.B fusionsoundrc
file contains one parameter per line. Comments are introduced by a
hash sign (#), and continue until the end of the line.  Blank lines
are ignored.
